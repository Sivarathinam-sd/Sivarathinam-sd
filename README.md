> Crafting end-to-end ML apps and learning by building.

---

## About
I’m a student pursuing M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I build end-to-end applications and update my projects continuously as I learn new techniques and tools.

---

## What I do
- Build end-to-end ML/AI applications (data → model → deploy)
- Keep my repositories up-to-date as I learn and iterate
- Focus on reproducible workflows and practical deployments

---

## Currently
- Generative AI (working with modern LLMs and generative models)  
- Building APIs and microservices with FastAPI  
- ML system design: model serving, pipelines, monitoring, and scalable deployments

## Projects
Project details are updated frequently in my repos — check my GitHub for the latest work.
